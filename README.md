Intro
----------
I'm sick of being late for meetings because my brain can't keep track of the time. So I made this program that sits
in the tray and causes the default browser to open the Zoom link at the start of the meeting time. It also shows
the next 10 meetings and if you click on them, it'll open the link early for you.

Install
----------
You'll have to start with Node 10.x or higher. Pull these files and then:
```shell
npm install
npm start
```
